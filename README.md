Design
# Colour Scheme
The two main colours used are green or white background with black or white font.
# Typography
I am currently using the Montserrat font throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Montserrat is a clean font used frequently in programming, so it is both attractive and appropriate.
# Imagery
Imagery is important. All images will be golf related and reflect the great scenery that is given to every golfer when they play a round of golf in Ireland.
